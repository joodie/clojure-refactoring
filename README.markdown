Old Clojure Refactoring Mode Relived
------------------------

This forked project provides the same refactoring functionality as the original one but mostly with these improvements: new test framework Mijde, upgrade to Clojure 1.5.0, migrated from SLIME to nREPL. I know there are still many things to do to build a full-blown refactoring tool, and this repo provides only the basic functionalities. But I hope people could regard this as a very good start towards automated refactoring tool and make contributions to it. I guess it was the best repo I can find online. 

Available refactorings
----------------------

Extract-fn - extracts the current expression and replaces it with a
call to it.

Global rename - Replaces all calls to the symbol at point (in the
current project) with the new name.

Thread-last - threads the current expression via `->>`

Thread-first - threads the current expression via `->`

Unthread - unthreads the current expression.

Extract global - defines the current expression as a global var for
this namespace (using `def`).

Extract local - defines the current expression as a local variable for
the current function definition.

Destructure map - Replaces calls to keywords on a particular map with
a destructuring for that map in the args. Only works on top-level defn
forms with one type of arity. Also only works for maps called with
keywords.

Rename - Changes a name just in this sexp.

Easy Installation
---

You cat get this via [Clojar](https://clojars.org/yehe/clojure-refactoring)

The `clojure-refactoring` Emacs functions will then be available
whenever you run `M-x clojure-jack-in` to start a nREPL session.

If you don't want to install as a leiningen plugin, you can also
declare clojure-refactoring as a dependency in your project.clj,
pom.xml or use some other dependency mechanism. As long as the
clojure-refactoring jar ends up on your class path, `clojure-jack-in`
will make sure the emacs interface is loaded.

If you don't use `clojure-jack-in`, see the section "Customized
Installation" below.


Usage
---

`clojure-refactoring-prompt` will be bound to `C-c C-f` when you're
running SLIME. Press `C-c C-f` at some point in the code and you will
be prompted to select a refactoring.

Note that global rename will be slow at first, as it has to read the
source files into a cache.

NOTE: Still in alpha, has some breakages. Report any problems via
Github Issues please.

Emacs dependencies
---

clojure-mode (with nrepl 0.1.8), paredit, and thing
at point.

Having ido-mode enabled is recommended when using
clojure-refactoring-prompt.

In general, this code is tested to work on
[emacs-24 pretest on OSX] [emacs-osx] with
[`starter-kit-lisp` version 2] [starter-kit] from [marmalade] [marmalade].

[emacs-osx]: http://emacsformacosx.com/builds
[starter-kit]: https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit
[marmalade]: http://marmalade-repo.org/

Customized Installation
---

If you don't want to use `clojure-jack-in`, you should install the jar
as usual (as a dependency in your project or as a leiningen plugin)
and then extract
`src/clojure_refactoring/payload/clojure-refactoring-mode.el` and put
it on your elisp load-path (for instance, copy to or symlink from
`$HOME/.emacs.d`) and `(require 'clojure-refactoring-mode)` in your
emacs's `init.el`.

Hacking Philosophy
--------------------

 * Wherever possible, have a reverse of each refactoring.
 * Refactoring should be quick
 * Refactoring names should correspond to known refactorings from OO
   (where possible).
 * Write a functional test for each refactoring (takes in a string and
   outputs the correct string).
